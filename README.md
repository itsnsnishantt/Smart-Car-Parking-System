This project deals with an effective way of finding empty spaces and managing the number of vehicles moving in and out in complex multi storeyed parking structures by detecting a vehicle using IR sensors and thus providing a feedback. The fully automated smart car parking system is rudimental and does not require heavy lines of code nor expensive equipment. It is a simple circuit built for the exact need of purpose. This automated system is used to find the vacancy in parking spaces available and navigate the driver to reach the desired space using visuals and in an effective manner, thus reducing search time. This system is required for malls, multistorey parking structures, IT hubs and parking facilities. This makes sure the requirement of labour is insubstantial.
