This project deals with an effective way of finding empty spaces and managing the number of vehicles moving in and out in complex multi storeyed parking structures by detecting a vehicle using IR sensors and thus providing a feedback. The fully automated smart car parking system is rudimental and does not require heavy lines of code nor expensive equipment. It is a simple circuit built for the exact need of purpose. This automated system is used to find the vacancy in parking spaces available and navigate the driver to reach the desired space using visuals and in an effective manner, thus reducing search time. This system is required for malls, multistorey parking structures, IT hubs and parking facilities. This makes sure the requirement of labour is insubstantial.

WORKING

Stage-1: When car enters the parking area IR sensor that is present before IN gate will detects the passing vehicle and the gate will be opened automatically. 

Stage-2: The car will enter into the parking area at that time person doesn't know which slot is empty, for this there will be an indication of LED's for every slot when the Green light glows the slot is empty when the red light glows the slot was filled. By this the person easily know which slot is empty. 

Stage-3: The operation of exit side will be same as that of the entrance. When the car is leaving the parking area, the IR sensor that is present before the OUT gate will detect the passing vehicle and the gate will be opened automatically. 

Stage-4: In front of the parking area, there will be an LCD display that is used to show the status of the parking the parking slots, whether the is available or not.
